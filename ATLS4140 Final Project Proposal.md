  
Bake\!

*I am up for any brutally honest feedback you have on my ideas since none of this comes naturally to me :\>*

This game will be a mix of the original Cooking Mama and Cuphead. Players will make a recipe, by doing each step of the baking process, they go through a Cuphead-inspired combat battle to gather ingredients for each process. Every process is different, with the player fighting or dodging ingredients to finish the recipe. If the player wins each battle they successfully make the recipe, however, if the player does not win the battle, they have failed the recipe and must retry. The design will lean more towards a modern version of Cooking Mama, rather than an old-school Cuphead style.
